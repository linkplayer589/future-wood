            <h3>CleverDeckÂ® Xtreme Composite Timber Decking</h3>
            <Typography variant="h6" component="p">CleverDeck Xtreme 138mm or 185mm wide solid WPC composite timber decking comes in 7 unique colours; Ash Grey, Rustic Merbau, Basalt, Desert Oak, Graphite, Limestone Grey and Riverstone Grey. Boards have a natural course texture pattern pressed in to the proprietary polymer skin. The back of the board has been specially scalloped to reduce weight and allow air flow between the bottom of the board and the joist helping to reduce heat build-up.</Typography>

            <Typography variant="p" component="p">
                All CleverDeck composite timber decking boards are available in long 5.4 metre lengths and come with the peace of mind that a "No fuss-unmatched warranty" provides and Futurewood is so sure of the quality and QA processes controlling the manufacturing of the CleverDeck Xtreme decking board that they also offer to cover all labour costs associated with replacing any decking for the first 3 years of the warranty.
